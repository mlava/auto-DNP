Automatically paste in your preferred daily note page template when you open your DNP for the first time each day.

This extension allows you to define templates for every day of the week, or for weekdays and weekends if you prefer to keep it simple.

**New:**
- use a command palette or hotkey command to manually trigger the DNP template - Manually trigger this day's DNP template
  - this could be useful if you want to go to a future or past date and paste the correct template
  - another use would be if you delete the template from today's DNP and then want to start over

Use the Roam Depot settings panel to choose either Daily or Weekday/Weekend for Preferred Mode.

Then, paste in the block reference of a template to the corresponding fields in the Roam Depot settings screen. The example below shows the configuration for Weekday/Weekend mode:

You can use blockrefs with (( )) or without the double parentheses.

Notes:
- the template will only be pasted into your DNP once. If you delete the blocks and then want to import the DNP template again, you can trigger it manually using the command palette or hotkey command: Manually trigger this day's DNP template
- if there is existing content on your DNP, the template will be pasted below that existing content.
