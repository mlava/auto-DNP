Automatically paste in your preferred daily note page template when you open your DNP for the first time each day.

This extension allows you to define templates for every day of the week, or for weekdays and weekends if you prefer to keep it simple.

Use the Roam Depot settings panel to choose either Daily or Weekday/Weekend for Preferred Mode.

Then, paste in the block reference of a template to the corresponding fields in the Roam Depot settings screen. The example below shows the configuration for Weekday/Weekend mode:

You can use blockrefs with (( )) or without the double parentheses.

Notes:
- the template will only be pasted into your DNP once... the extension checks if the first line of your template is present on the page already, and won't run again if it finds it. However, if you happen to delete the first line and then navigate away and then back, the template will be pasted in again. I don't know why you would do this, but fair warning.
- if there is existing content on your DNP, the template will be pasted below that existing content.
